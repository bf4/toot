# Toot

An interesting command-line Twitter client

Developed by [Benjamin Fleischer](https://github.com/bf4/toot)

## Wherefore and Whence

Toot is derived from Gary Bernhardt's
[Destroy All Software Screencast](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts)
series, specifically, episode 71 [Test Isolation Without Mocks](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/test-isolation-without-mocks)
and episode 72 [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell).

Some years after the episodes, I decided to try to reconstruct as
much of the code as I could, for better review.

The code here is entirely my repsonsibility for support etc. It was written
by me and is neither written nor endorsed by Destroy all Software.

Destroy All Software has given me permission to release this under
the MIT license.

### On Twitter

Despite the code here being a Twitter client, its main purpose is for learning.
There are several reasons to be uncomfortable with writing client apps for Twitter.

- ["Twitter tells third-party devs to stop making Twitter client apps"](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/03/twitter-tells-third-party-devs-to-stop-making-twitter-client-apps/)
- [which came from the same announcement as the infamous "quadrants"
image](http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-api-changes-chart-2012-8)
- [Twitter recently killed Twitpic with legal threats after it had
existed as an extremely popular companion to Twitter for eight years.](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6106735/twitpic-is-dead-because-twitter-killed-it)
- [Twitter's API limitations have been killing third party clients at an
alarming rate over the last few years. For example, this month MetroTwit
died](http://www.techspot.com/news/55902-twitters-access-token-limit-claims-another-victim-as-metrotwit-shuts-down.html). This stems from changes that accompanied the "quadrant"
announcement.
